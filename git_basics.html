                    <h1>What is Git?</h1>
                    <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots
                        (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, 
                        seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come
                        back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into the app.
                    </p>
                    <h1>What is Github?</h1>
                    <p> Github is a code hosting platform for version vontrol and collaboration.
                        It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that
                        you took during development</p>

                        <p><span class="teal_font">Git add</span> is how we stage the integration of our current code base into our current list of snapshots.</p>

                        a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made.</p>

                        our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                        <p><span class="teal_font">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositiories. Other 
                        developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new 
                        features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add.</p>
